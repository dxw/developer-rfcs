# dxw Request For Comments

dxw staff use this repository as a forum to make and document technical decisions.

## Process

1. Create a new branch on this repo and copy `rfc-000-template.md` to `rfc-000-my-proposal.md` and edit.
1. Include any images etc in a separate directory named `rfc-000` and link to them.
1. Make a Pull Request (PR) for your branch.
1. Rename your file and directory with the number of the PR and push as a new commits.
1. Post a link to your PR in #tech-team on Slack. @mention teams or individuals in the PR description if you want particular attention from them.
1. GOV.UK members discuss your proposal using both inline comments against your RFC document and the general PR comments section. Non-technical staff will need to create a free Github account in order to comment.
1. As changes are requested and agreed in comments, make the changes in your RFC and push them as new commits.
1. Stay active in the discussion and encourage and remind other relevant people to participate. If you're unsure who should be involved in a discussion, ask a senior developer or CTO. If you start an RFC it's up to you to push it through the process and engage people.
1. After notifications are sent there is a minimum 14 day period where it must remain open for comments before consensus can be made. Once this period has passed we try to reach consensus between active participants
1. Once consensus is reached and approvals given using the Github review system, the PR can be merged.
1. When an RFC is accepted, ensure the dxw tech team is made aware of it via Slack.
1. An RFC can be rejected. This can happen if a consensus isn't reached, or people agree rejecting it is the right thing to do. In this case the PR should be closed with a suitable comment.
