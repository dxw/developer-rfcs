# Keep support documentation with code

## Summary

Support and other technical documentation should be kept with the code it documents, so that it can be found easily.

## Problem

Support documentation exists in multiple places currently, and can be confusing. Some projects have `doc` directories, some don't, and some have multiple sources of truth. We should aim to standardise this.

As well as making documentation easier to find, having it in standard locations makes future automation of support documentation easier.

## Proposal

All source code repositories MUST have a `README.md` file in the root. This file MUST include a link to support documentation under a `Support` heading.

All repositories MAY contain a `doc` folder. 

If it exists, the documentation folder MUST include a file named `support.md` which acts as a first port of call for support users.

If the repository has a `doc` folder, the readme SHOULD link to the `support.md` file within it under this heading.

If a repository does not contain a documentation folder, the support section in the README MUST contain a link to support details, ideally to another related repository that includes a documentation folder.

`support.md` MUST include details of (or a link to another file which describes) how to:

* run the code in a development environment
* deploy the code
* perform common support and administration tasks

## Next steps

The rails-template project should have example documentation added to it.
